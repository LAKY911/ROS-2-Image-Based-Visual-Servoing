# oakd_models
URDF models, materials and Gazebo demo worlds for the Luxonis OAKD v1 Stereo AI Camera. 
You will need to run stereo_image_proc along with this model to get disparity images and pointcloud. 

I've validated this model on the Gazebo simulation of my rover, [Tenacity](https://github.com/jetdillo/tenacity_rover), but haven't tested it extensively on other simulations/worlds. \
This replicates the OAKD B&W cameras as described on the [Luxonis Hardware page about the OAK-D](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1098OAK.html#depth-perception) along with the center RGB camera.
 
You should be able to just drop this into an existing URDF as a xacro macro.
Go check out [Tenacity](https://github.com/jetdillo/tenacity_rover) if you need an example of how to do that. 
If you don't know how to work with XACRO The [ROS Wiki](wiki.ros.org) has a good [tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Using%20Xacro%20to%20Clean%20Up%20a%20URDF%20File) on the subject. 

This is an initial release of this model, so there might be bugs, inefficiencies, parameters that could be better specified, etc. 
I'm open to feedback, bugs, PRs, etc. 

Thanks,
